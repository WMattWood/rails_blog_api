https://medium.com/@matt.readout/rails-generators-model-vs-resource-vs-scaffold-19d6e24168ee


Here is a quick reference for the differences between generating a Model, Resource, or Scaffold using rails commands


```
$ rails g model POST
```
Model: 
-creates a db migration file for generating the table in your db `class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration`
-creates a model in app/models/post.rb
`class Post < ApplicationRecord`
-creates some test stubs


```
$ rails g resource POST
```
Resource:
-creates a db migration file
-creates a Post model
-creates a Post controller
-opens up routes in config/routes.rb
```
	Rails.application.routes.draw do
	  resources :users
	end
```
-more tests


```
$ rails g scaffold POST
```
Scaffold: 
-creates a db migration file
-creates a Post model
-creates a Post controller
-creates a full set of CRUD methods in the Post controller
-opens up routes in config/routes.rb
-lots of tests
