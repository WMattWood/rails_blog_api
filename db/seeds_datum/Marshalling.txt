What is Marshalling?

Marshalling is the process of converting a memory representation of an object into a data format which can be stored or transmitted.  

It is desirable for the converted data format to be of a common - or close to universal - standard (ie. JSON or XML) such that it can be easily parsed by common “adapters”.  Many languages and frameworks implement the ability to parse JSON, and thus it can be used a kind of common protocol for transferring data.

In Ruby, one can use Marshalling to execute deep copies of an object in a simple way.  However, if dealing with relatively simple data structures such as Hashes or Arrays, it can actually be faster in Ruby to perform a deep copy using “manual” copying with the Hash & Array classes’ native iterating method #each.
