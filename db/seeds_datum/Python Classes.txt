In python, classes are defined via the following syntax

class ClassName:

	# initialization method for instances of the class
	def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
		self.quality = arg1
		self.other_quality = arg2

	# instance method
	def my_method(self):
		#some code

	# class method
	def class_method():
		#this can be called by the class



Throughout the class definition, python uses `self` to reference the instance of the class.  So Instance Variables are referenced as `self.variable`.  Simply declaring the variables with no `self` will define them as class variables shared between all instance of the class.  

This differs from many other languages where instance variables are referenced with `@`.  Additionally, many other languages use `self` to refer to the Class itself within a class definition.  So important to be aware of!

Self must also be explicitly passed to every instance method.


***

When we call `instance.method(args)`, it actually translates out to `Class.method(instance, args)`
