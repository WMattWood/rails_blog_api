Ruby Multiline String Formatting

https://ruby-doc.com/core/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Here+Documents

Ruby uses the HEREDOC construct to make a multiline string.  The bounds of the multiline paragraph are marked by the `<<HEREDOC` opening tag and the `HEREDOC` closing tag.

The name is short hand for “Here, document.”

The syntax is as follows:

```
my_multiline_string = <<HEREDOC
Within these lines here...

This...

...is where I will write my multiple lines.
HEREDOC
```

If you need to insert this HEREDOC into your code in a position where it is indented (ie. nested inside of a method definition) you can use a squiggly HEREDOC to tell Ruby to ignore trailing spaces when the string is parsed. `<<~HEREDOC`.

In my opinion, thiis is actually an area where Javascript outshines Ruby by allowing a straightforward usage of Template Literals (basically any string bounded by backticks) as introduced in ES6.  There is nothing special required to ensure a multiline string, simply press enter and new lines are automatically encoded when using backticks.  Easy!
